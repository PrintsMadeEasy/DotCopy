        <b>Positioning &amp; Re-Sizing</b><br/>
        <br/>
      <p>When the Variable Image is substituted into the artwork file it will 
        take the coordinates of the Image variable. Remember that the image variable 
        will be in a text layer and look something like {IMAGE:YourVariableName}<br/>
        <br/>
        The text layer containing the variable name will be completely removed 
        and replaced by the image, so don't include other text in there that you 
        wish to be printed. By default the Lower-Left portion of the image will 
        be orientated exactly where the top left portion of the text layer was. 
        There is no need to right-alight or center-align a text layer, but if 
        you do, the image will be aligned at the top-center, or top-right of the 
        text layer, respectively.<br/>
        <br/>
        If all of your images are exactly the same size then the following does 
        not apply. If your images are all different sizes you may need to have 
        the image centered or right aligned in relation to the coordinate of the 
        text layer. You can also vertically align the image at the top, middle, 
        or bottom, in relation to the coordinates of the text layer. This is accomplished 
        by adding attributes inside of the text layer that is shared by the Variable 
        Image Name. The following are all of the possible choices you may use 
        for alignment purposes. <br/>
        <br/>
        Please use only one for the horizontal alignment and one for the vertical.<br/>
        <font color="#990000">{IMAGE:YourVarName} (Alignment:Left) (Alignment:Center) 
        (Alignment:Right) (VerticalAlign:Top) (VerticalAlign:Middle) (VerticalAlign:Bottom)</font><br/>
        <br/>
        Generally you should re-size your images ahead of time so that they will 
        print correctly at the given DPI, usually 200 or 300. You may also add 
        attributes (similar to the way alignment attributes are added) for the 
        purpose of re-sizing your images. <br/>
        <br/>
        There are many combinations you can apply. The two main attributes are 
        specifying an Exact Width/Height or a Maximum Height/Width. If you specify 
        a Maximum or Exact Width but not a height, then the height may be adjusted 
        proportionally and vic versa.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you specify a both an exact width and height then Variable Image will 
        conform to those specifications without regards to the proportion. If 
        you specify a maximum width and a maximum height then the system will 
        take the smallest version of the 2 and re-size the other leg proportionally. 
        It is also possible to do such things as specify an exact width and a 
        maximum height.<br/>
        <br/>
        In order to see how the attributes have affected your project you will 
        need to view a &quot;PDF Preview with Data Merge&quot;. Below all all 
        of the possible attributes relating to re-sizing.<br/>
        <br/>
		<font color="#990000">{IMAGE:YourVarName} (MaxWidth:100) (MaxHeight:100) 
        (ExactWidth:100) (ExactHeight:100)</font><br/><br/>
        The values of the re-sizing attributes are in Picas. That means each unit 
        is 1/72 of an inch. If you want your image to be printed 1 inch wide by 
        1.5 inches tall, the measurements would be (ExactWidth:72) (ExactHeight:108).
