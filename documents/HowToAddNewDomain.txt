How to add a new Printing Portal Domain
=======================================

*) Do this during off hours because Apache may go offline temporarily.  
	- The newer version of Apache 2.2 is not tied into the Cpanel auto-init.  Apache won't restart by itself after adding a new Account to Cpanel... but it will stop it!
	- If you add a new domain during working hours, make sure to be logged into SSH (root) so that you can quickly restart Apache 2.2 after making changes in Cpanel.

*) Pick a new IP Address out of /documents/PME_NAT_Translation.txt
	- Keep track of the Private IP (behind the NAT firewall) and the public IP.
	
*) Possibly add entries with the Private IP's to /documents/ip_tables.txt
	- Generally this is necessary to keep competitors (or Google bots) from itterating through sequential IP addresses on the main server.
	- Only add to the IP Tables after a "reverse proxy" has been defined.

*) Add add a new account in Cpanel
	- https://www.printsmadeeasy.com:2087    (create a new account)
		... MAKE SURE TO RESTART APACHE MANUALLY ASAP (from Shell as "root")
			root> /usr/local/apache2_2/bin/apachectl restart
	- Make sure that the domain name is not real... or it will cause DNS conflicts since actual Mail Server and domain is external (on a proxy).  For example... instead of "ThankYouCards.com" create a domain like "ThnkYouCrds.com"
	- Write down the password.  If the website front-end is meant to be run though a reverse-proxy... the password is only needed to FTP files (cpanel won't be used).
	- After the account has been created, be sure to disable "Shell Access" and "CGI Privilage".  [Cpanel Main >> Account Functions >> Modify an Account]
	- Change the Site's IP Address to the Private NAT.... [Cpanel Main >> Account Functions >> Change Site's IP Address]
		... MAKE SURE TO RESTART APACHE MANUALLY ASAP (from Shell as "root")
			root> /usr/local/apache2_2/bin/apachectl restart
	
	
*) Add new Domain entries into the class /classes/Domain.php
	- Do a search through similar accounts and see where else things need to be changed.
	- For the sandbox path... make sure to use the "Account Name" from Cpanel.
	
*) Add the domain key to /classes/Authenticate.php for the appropriate people.


*) Create 3 logos for the new site.
	- Very Small Icon:  Max Width of 50px PNG
	- Nav Bar Image:  Max Width of 130px PNG
	- Print Quality:  Max Width of 350px 
	- Add the logos to /classes/DomainLogos.php
	
*) Create a directory writable by "nobody" for the web-server
	- mkdir /home/accountname/public_html/previews
	- chgrp nobody /home/accountname/public_html/previews
	- chmod g+w /home/accountname/public_html/previews


*) Edit the Apache configuration
	- First make a copy of the file.
		cp /usr/local/apache2_2/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /usr/local/apache2_2/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf.bakxxx
	- Add a new chunk to the bottom of the file for the new domain.  There is no need to make a new SSL certificate or change the Account Path.
	- MAKE SURE that the domain you add matches the "Domain Alias" from Domain.php
	- Put in the Private IP address for this domain.
	- Save the new file and restart the Apache web server.  /usr/local/apache2_2/bin/apachectl restart


*) Create new files for the log rotation at /etc/logrotate.d


*) After all of the PHP scripts have been uploaded... Make sure to add a default shipping choice.  In the backend go to "Configure -> Shipping"
	* Make sure to also set the new shipping choice as "Default" and as "Basic Choice" to make sure that it shows up in the delivery calculator.


*) Update Secure Password File for developers

*) Add a new "Project" within JIRA
