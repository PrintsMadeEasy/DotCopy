	<b>Overview</b><br/><br/>
      Variable Imaging is a high-tech way to print. Not all customers have the
      need or capability to use this feature, but if you do, we can
      help. <br/>
      <br/>
      Variable data allows each item within an order to be printed uniquely, specific
      for the person who will read it. This can be as simple as merging their
      Name or Address onto each product. With Variable Images you can go one step
      further and print each item with separate images. <br/>
      <br/>
      For example, let's say a mortgage broker has access to a database of images
      of people's homes. They can really catch people's attention by sending them
      a postcard with a picture of their house and a personalized greeting. Or
      maybe an automotive company may send a personalized greeting with the an
      image of the customer's exact car (make and model).<br/>
      <br/>
      How it works... You upload a batch of images onto the 
      server. You need to put a special Variable within your artwork design (using
      the Editing Tool) as a place holder where the image will
      be substituted. Then you correlate your data file so that the names in the
      data file match up to the images that you uploaded. <br/>
