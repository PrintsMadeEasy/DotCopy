	<b>Uploading Images</b><br/><br/>
      All of the images that you plan on using within your Variable Data project 
      must be uploaded onto the server. We provide a tool that 
      will allow you to upload many images at once. The software is written in 
      Active X and Java. You may get a warning message that the program must be 
      installed on your computer... just select Yes. <br/>
      <br/>
      If you plan on uploading thousands of images we recommend doing it in batches 
      of a couple hundred or so. In case you lose your Internet connection or 
      something it will be easier to deal with the problem.<br/>
      <br/>
      No single image can exceed 1 MB and the only formats accepted are PNG, GIF, 
      JPEG, TIFF, and BMP. If your artwork is in another artwork format you must 
      convert it. <br/>
      <br/>
      In case of a corrupt image or a file size that is too large, our uploading 
      program will silently skip over it. You will not get any warning or error 
      message that a particular image did not upload correctly. However you can 
      launch a pop-up window to show you what images have been successfully imported. 
      This list may be useful for troubleshooting purposes and you can even see 
      a preview of each image.<br/>
      <br/>
      Try to get your images re-sized at the proper DPI before uploading them 
      to our server. Sometimes people will upload large image files and it may 
      slow down the process significantly if our server has to re-size and process 
      a very large quantity.
