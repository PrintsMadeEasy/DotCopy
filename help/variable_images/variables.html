	<b>Configuring Variables</b><br/><br/>
      The first thing to do is to get your artwork the way you like it (without 
      any variable information). Try printing out a copy on your home/office printer 
      to make sure you are happy with the size of the fonts, layout, etc. <br/>
      <br/>
      When everything looks good it is time to go into the Editing 
      Tool and put in place holders (technically called Variables) to indicate 
      where information from your data file will be substituted. Variables are 
      simply bits of text surrounded with curly brackets. You can name the variables 
      whatever you want and you can have as many as you want. Here are some examples 
      of general variables.<br/>
      <br/>
      {FirstName}, {LastName}, {Address}<br/>
      <br/>
      Variables for &quot;Variable Images&quot; are not much different. The only 
      extra thing you need to do is to place a special keyword in front with a 
      colon... &quot;IMAGE:&quot;. Here are a couple examples of Image Variables.<br/>
      <br/>
      {IMAGE:House1}, {IMAGE:PersonPhoto}<br/>
      <br/>
      Make sure the word IMAGE is in all caps and that there are no spaces. <br/>
      <br/>
      When you are done, save your artwork and should see the variables are automatically 
      recognized on the following screen. To remove a variable, simply remove 
      the text in curly brackets from your artwork. <br/>&nbsp;
