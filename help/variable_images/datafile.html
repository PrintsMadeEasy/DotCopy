        <b>Integrating With Data File</b><br/>
        <br/>
        At this point you should have 1 or more Image Variables within your artwork 
        and all of your images uploaded onto the server.<br/>
        <br/>
        You will need to upload your Data file, usually built in Microsoft Excel. 
        One of the columns in the file should contain a list of all images (matching 
        up to the images you uploaded). Do not include the Path to the image on 
        your computer, just the image name and extension. Ex: &quot;something.jpg&quot;. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You need to map the Image Variable position to the correlating column 
        of your Data file (containing the image names). Select a new value in 
        the drop down menus to change positions of the Artwork Mappings. <br/>
        <br/>
        Generally the error messages should be informative. Read them carefully 
        and it should guide you to what is causing the problem. Remember that 
        you can always save your project and contact Customer Service.
